    abstract={We discuss the applicability of simplified Two-Ray Ground path loss models to simulation-based performance evaluation studies of Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols. We contrast this with the applicability of a more exact Two-Ray Interference model. A key result is that, in most cases, the commonly used simplified Two-Ray Ground models add no additional value compared to the most simple Free-space model - in particular in highway and suburban environments. We further argue that replacing a simplified with a fully featured Two-Ray Interference model can not only substantially improve the accuracy of simulation results but also allow capturing one notable artifact that becomes immediately visible in field tests, namely strong signal attenuation at short and medium ranges. We implemented the Two-ray Interference model within the Veins simulation framework and validated it using analytical predictions and field measurements. We show the impact of the more accurate Two-Ray Interference model, which only comes with negligible additional computational cost for simulation experiments.},

    abstract={This tutorial presents an overview of the technological advances in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) circuit components, antennas, and propagation that will soon allow 60-GHz transceivers to provide multigigabit per second (multi-Gb/s) wireless communication data transfers in the consumer marketplace. Our goal is to help engineers understand the convergence of communications, circuits, and antennas, as the emerging world of subterahertz and terahertz wireless communications will require understanding at the intersections of these areas. This paper covers trends and recent accomplishments in a wide range of circuits and systems topics that must be understood to create massively broadband wireless communication systems of the future. In this paper, we present some evolving applications of massively broadband wireless communications, and use tables and graphs to show research progress from the literature on various radio system components, including on-chip and in-package antennas, radio-frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs), low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), mixers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We focus primarily on silicon-based technologies, as these provide the best means of implementing very low-cost, highly integrated 60-GHz mm-wave circuits. In addition, the paper illuminates characterization techniques that are required to competently design and fabricate mm-wave devices in silicon, and illustrates effects of the 60-GHz RF propagation channel for both in-building and outdoor use. The paper concludes with an overview of the standardization and commercialization efforts for 60-GHz multi-Gb/s devices, and presents a novel way to compare the data rate versus power efficiency for future broadband devices.},

    abstract={The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band spanning from 30 to 300 GHz constitutes a substantial portion of the unused frequency spectrum, which is an important resource for future wireless communication systems in order to fulfill the escalating capacity demand. Given the improvements in integrated components and enhanced power efficiency at high frequencies, wireless systems can operate in the mmWave frequency band. In this paper, we present a survey of the mmWave propagation characteristics, channel modeling, and design guidelines, such as system and antenna design considerations for mmWave, including the link budget of the network, which are essential for mmWave communication systems. We commence by introducing the main channel propagation characteristics of mmWaves followed by channel modeling and design guidelines. Then, we report on the main measurement and modeling campaigns conducted in order to understand the mmWave band's properties and present the associated channel models. We survey the different channel models focusing on the channel models available for the 28, 38, 60, and 73 GHz frequency bands. Finally, we present the mmWave channel model and its challenges in the context of mmWave communication systems design.},

    abstract="With the explosive growth of mobile data demand, the fifth generation (5G) mobile network would exploit the enormous amount of spectrum in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to greatly increase communication capacity. There are fundamental differences between mmWave communications and existing other communication systems, in terms of high propagation loss, directivity, and sensitivity to blockage. These characteristics of mmWave communications pose several challenges to fully exploit the potential of mmWave communications, including integrated circuits and system design, interference management, spatial reuse, anti-blockage, and dynamics control. To address these challenges, we carry out a survey of existing solutions and standards, and propose design guidelines in architectures and protocols for mmWave communications. We also discuss the potential applications of mmWave communications in the 5G network, including the small cell access, the cellular access, and the wireless backhaul.

    abstract={This paper investigates the extent to which spectrum sharing in millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks with multiple cellular operators is a viable alternative to traditional dedicated spectrum allocation. Specifically, we develop a general mathematical framework to characterize the performance gain that can be obtained when spectrum sharing is used, as a function of the underlying beamforming, operator coordination, bandwidth, and infrastructure sharing scenarios. The framework is based on joint beamforming and cell association optimization, with the objective of maximizing the long-term throughput of the users. Our asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance analyses reveal five key points: 1) spectrum sharing with light on-demand intra- and inter-operator coordination is feasible, especially at higher mmWave frequencies (for example, 73 GHz); 2) directional communications at the user equipment substantially alleviate the potential disadvantages of spectrum sharing (such as higher multiuser interference); 3) large numbers of antenna elements can reduce the need for coordination and simplify the implementation of spectrum sharing; 4) while inter-operator coordination can be neglected in the large-antenna regime, intra-operator coordination can still bring gains by balancing the network load; and 5) critical control signals among base stations, operators, and user equipment should be protected from the adverse effects of spectrum sharing, for example by means of exclusive resource allocation. The results of this paper, and their extensions obtained by relaxing some ideal assumptions, can provide important insights for future standardization and spectrum policy.},

    abstract={The millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band is seen as a key enabler of multigigabit wireless access in future cellular networks. In order to overcome the propagation challenges, mmWave systems use a large number of antenna elements both at the base station and at the user equipment, which leads to high directivity gains, fully directional communications, and possible noise-limited operations. The fundamental differences between mmWave networks and traditional ones challenge the classical design constraints, objectives, and available degrees of freedom. This paper addresses the implications that highly directional communication has on the design of an efficient medium access control (MAC) layer. The paper discusses key MAC layer issues, such as synchronization, random access, handover, channelization, interference management, scheduling, and association. This paper provides an integrated view on MAC layer issues for cellular networks, identifies new challenges and tradeoffs, and provides novel insights and solution approaches.},

    abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications systems are promising candidate to support extremely high data rate services in future wireless networks. MmWave communications exhibit high penetration loss (blockage) and require directional transmissions to compensate for severe channel attenuations and for high noise powers. When blockage occurs, there are at least two simple prominent options: 1) switching to the conventional microwave frequencies (fallback option) and 2) using an alternative non-blocked path (relay option). However, currently it is not clear under which conditions and network parameters one option is better than the other. To investigate the performance of the two options, this paper proposes a novel blockage model that allows deriving maximum achievable throughput and delay performance of both options. A simple criterion to decide which option should be taken under which network condition is provided. By a comprehensive performance analysis, it is shown that the right option depends on the payload size, beam training overhead, and blockage probability. For a network with light traffic and low probability of blockage in the direct link, the fallback option is throughput- and delay-optimal. For a network with heavy traffic demands and semistatic topology (low beam-training overhead), the relay option is preferable.},

    abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has raised increasing attentions from both academia and industry due to its exceptional advantages. Compared with existing wireless communication techniques, such as WiFi and 4G, mmWave communications adopt much higher carrier frequencies and thus come with advantages including huge bandwidth, narrow beam, high transmission quality, and strong detection ability. These advantages can well address difficult situations caused by recent popular applications using wireless technologies. For example, mmWave communications can significantly alleviate the skyrocketing traffic demand of wireless communication from video streaming. Meanwhile, mmWave communications have several natural disadvantages, e.g., severe signal attenuation, easily blocked by obstacles, and small coverage, due to its short wavelengths. Hence, the major challenge is how to overcome its shortcomings while fully utilizing its advantages. In this paper, we present a taxonomy based on the layered model and give an extensive review on mmWave communications. Specially, we divide existing efforts into four categories that investigate: physical layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, network layer, and cross layer optimization, respectively. First, we present an overview of some technical details in physical layer. Second, we summarize available literature in MAC layer that pertains to protocols and scheduling schemes. Third, we make an in-depth survey of related research work in network layer, providing brain storming and methodology for enhancing the capacity and coverage of mmWave networks. Fourth, we analyze available research work related to cross layer allocation/optimization for mmWave communications. Fifth, we make a review of mmWave applications to illustrate how mmWave technology can be employed to satisfy other services. At the end of each section described above, we point out the inadequacy of existing work and identify the future work. Sixth, we present some available resources for mmWave communications, including related books about mmWave, commonly used mmWave frequencies, existing protocols based on mmWave, and experimental platforms. Finally, we have a simple summary and point out several promising future research directions.},

 pages={245-259}, 
 abstract={We propose an iterative channel estimation algorithm based on the least square estimation (LSE) and sparse message passing (SMP) algorithm for the millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. The channel coefficients of the mmWave MIMO are approximately modeled as a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution and the channel matrix is sparse with only a few nonzero entries. By leveraging the advantage of sparseness, we propose an algorithm that iteratively detects the exact locations and values of nonzero entries of the sparse channel matrix. At each iteration, the locations are detected by the SMP, and values are estimated with the LSE. We also analyze the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CLRB), and show that the proposed algorithm is a minimum variance unbiased estimator under the assumption that we have the partial priori knowledge of the channel. Furthermore, we employ the Gaussian approximation for message densities under density evolution to simplify the analysis of the algorithm, which provides a simple method to predict the performance of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm has much better performance than the existing sparse estimators, especially when the channel is sparse. In addition, our proposed algorithm converges to the CRLB of the genie-aided estimation of sparse channels with only five turbo iterations.},
