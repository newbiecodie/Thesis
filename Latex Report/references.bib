    abstract = {We discuss the applicability of simplified Two-Ray Ground path loss models to simulation-based performance evaluation studies of Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols. We contrast this with the applicability of a more exact Two-Ray Interference model. A key result is that, in most cases, the commonly used simplified Two-Ray Ground models add no additional value compared to the most simple Free-space model -- in particular in highway and suburban environments. We further argue that replacing a simplified with a fully featured Two-Ray Interference model can not only substantially improve the accuracy of simulation results but also allow capturing one notable artifact that becomes immediately visible in field tests, namely strong signal attenuation at short and medium ranges. We implemented the Two-ray Interference model within the Veins simulation framework and validated it using analytical predictions and field measurements. We show the impact of the more accurate Two-Ray Interference model, which only comes with negligible additional computational cost for simulation experiments.},

    abstract="With the explosive growth of mobile data demand, the fifth generation (5G) mobile network would exploit the enormous amount of spectrum in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to greatly increase communication capacity. There are fundamental differences between mmWave communications and existing other communication systems, in terms of high propagation loss, directivity, and sensitivity to blockage. These characteristics of mmWave communications pose several challenges to fully exploit the potential of mmWave communications, including integrated circuits and system design, interference management, spatial reuse, anti-blockage, and dynamics control. To address these challenges, we carry out a survey of existing solutions and standards, and propose design guidelines in architectures and protocols for mmWave communications. We also discuss the potential applications of mmWave communications in the 5G network, including the small cell access, the cellular access, and the wireless backhaul. Finally, we discuss relevant open research issues including the new physical layer technology, software-defined network architecture, measurements of network state information, efficient control mechanisms, and heterogeneous networking, which should be further investigated to facilitate the deployment of mmWave communication systems in the future 5G networks.",

    abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has raised increasing attentions from both academia and industry due to its exceptional advantages. Compared with existing wireless communication techniques, such as WiFi and 4G, mmWave communications adopt much higher carrier frequencies and thus come with advantages including huge bandwidth, narrow beam, high transmission quality, and strong detection ability. These advantages can well address difficult situations caused by recent popular applications using wireless technologies. For example, mmWave communications can significantly alleviate the skyrocketing traffic demand of wireless communication from video streaming. Meanwhile, mmWave communications have several natural disadvantages, e.g., severe signal attenuation, easily blocked by obstacles, and small coverage, due to its short wavelengths. Hence, the major challenge is how to overcome its shortcomings while fully utilizing its advantages. In this paper, we present a taxonomy based on the layered model and give an extensive review on mmWave communications. Specially, we divide existing efforts into four categories that investigate: physical layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, network layer, and cross layer optimization, respectively. First, we present an overview of some technical details in physical layer. Second, we summarize available literature in MAC layer that pertains to protocols and scheduling schemes. Third, we make an in-depth survey of related research work in network layer, providing brain storming and methodology for enhancing the capacity and coverage of mmWave networks. Fourth, we analyze available research work related to cross layer allocation/optimization for mmWave communications. Fifth, we make a review of mmWave applications to illustrate how mmWave technology can be employed to satisfy other services. At the end of each section described above, we point out the inadequacy of existing work and identify the future work. Sixth, we present some available resources for mmWave communications, including related books about mmWave, commonly used mmWave frequencies, existing protocols based on mmWave, and experimental platforms. Finally, we have a simple summary and point out several promising future research directions.},

    abstract = {The emerging 60-GHz multigigabits per second wireless technology enables the streaming of high-quality {``}uncompressed{''} video, which has been impossible with other existing wireless technologies. To support such a resource-hungry uncompressed video streaming service with limited wireless resources, it is necessary to design efficient link adaptation policies selecting suitable transmission rates for the 60-GHz wireless channel environment, thus optimizing video quality and resource management. For proper design of the link adaptation policies, we propose a new metric, called expected peak signal-to-noise ratio (ePSNR), to numerically estimate the video streaming quality. By using the ePSNR as a criterion, we propose two link adaptation policies with different objectives considering unequal error protection (UEP). The proposed link adaptation policies attempt to 1) maximize the video quality for given wireless resources, or 2) minimize the required wireless resources, while meeting the video quality. From the link adaptation policies, we provide a distributed resource management scheme for multiple users to maintain satisfactory video streaming quality. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that the newly proposed variable, i.e., ePSNR, well represents the level of video quality. It is also shown that the proposed link adaptation policies can enhance the resource efficiency while achieving acceptable quality of the video streaming.},

Such wide bandwidths are valuable in supporting applications such as high speed data transmission and video distribution. Planning for millimeter wave spectrum use must take into account the propagation characteristics of radio signals at this frequency range. While signals at lower frequency bands can propagate for many miles and penetrate more easily through buildings, millimeter wave signals can travel only a few miles or less and do not penetrate solid materials very well. However, these characteristics of millimeter wave propagation are not necessarily disadvantageous. Millimeter waves can permit more densely packed communications links, thus providing very efficient spectrum utilization, and they can increase security of communication transmissions. This article reviews characteristics of millimeter wave propagation, including free space propagation and the effects of various physical factors on propagation.},

Equipments operating in the submillimeter band can measure distance and also spectral information and have been used to address new opportunities in security. Solid state spectral information is available in the submillimeter region making it possible to identify materials, whereas in millimeter region bulk optical properties determine the image contrast. The optical properties in the region from 30 GHz to 3 THz are discussed for some typical inorganic and organic solids. In the millimeter-wave region of the spectrum, obscurants such as poor weather, dust, and smoke can be penetrated and useful imagery generated for surveillance. In the 30 GHz-3 THz region dielectrics such as plastic and cloth are also transparent and the detection of contraband hidden under clothing is possible. A passive millimeter-wave imaging concept based on a folded Schmidt camera has been developed and applied to poor weather navigation and security. The optical design uses a rotating mirror and is folded using polarization techniques. The design is very well corrected over a wide field of view making it ideal for surveillance and security. This produces a relatively compact imager which minimizes the receiver count.},

    abstract = {The paper aims to provide a high-level view of 5G fronthaul and backhaul wireless transport over millimeter wave (mmWave). In particular, an overview of data rate and latency requirements for three emerging fronthaul interfaces (functional split options) in addition to the backhaul will be given first. Then, the suitability of mmWave technology for transport of these fronthaul and backhaul traffics are examined, where the scope is focused on a multi-tier architecture with multiple levels of aggregation. The characteristics of mmWave spectrum under consideration for the mobile fronthaul and backhaul, including V, E, W and D bands, will also be discussed. This is prospective that mmWave transport network will roll-out with two sequential phases, namely below and above 100 GHz.},

@article{akyildiz2018combating,
    abstract = {In the millimeter-wave (30-300 GHz) and terahertz (0.1-10 THz) frequency bands, the high spreading loss and molecular absorption often limit the signal transmission distance and coverage range. In this article, four directions to tackle the crucial problem of distance limitation are investigated, namely, a distance-aware physical layer design, ultra-massive MIMO communication, reflectarrays, and intelligent surfaces. Additionally, the potential joint design of these solutions is proposed to combine the benefits and further extend the communication distance. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed solutions. The feasibility of mmWave and THz band communications up to 100 m in both line-of-sight and nonline- of-sight areas are demonstrated.},

The 60 GHz millimeter-wave wireless technology is getting increasing attention, and the IEEE 802.11 Task Group AD is making standardization efforts for multi-gigabit data rate communications on both the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers. This paper presents a performance evaluation of the PHY and MAC layers of IEEE 802.1 lad. Packet error rate and PHY throughput are presented for different modes, and the theoretical MAC throughput is analyzed for different bit error rates, packet sizes and modes. In addition, 2$\times$2 space-time block coding (STBC) is employed for range extension. The cross layer results show our approach enhance the throughput and coverage compared to the case of single antenna.},

@article{akdeniz2014millimeter,
    abstract = {With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands, millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz have been attracting growing attention as a possible candidate for next-generation micro- and picocellular wireless networks. The mmW bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna arrays for further gains via beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper uses recent real-world measurements at 28 and 73 GHz in New York, NY, USA, to derive detailed spatial statistical models of the channels and uses these models to provide a realistic assessment of mmW micro- and picocellular networks in a dense urban deployment. Statistical models are derived for key channel parameters, including the path loss, number of spatial clusters, angular dispersion, and outage. It is found that, even in highly non-line-of-sight environments, strong signals can be detected 100-200 m from potential cell sites, potentially with multiple clusters to support spatial multiplexing. Moreover, a system simulation based on the models predicts that mmW systems can offer an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks with no increase in cell density from current urban deployments.},

@article{shokrighadikolaei2016transitional,
    abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems use a large number of antenna elements that can potentially overcome severe channel attenuation by narrow beamforming. Narrow-beam operation in mmWave networks also reduces multiuser interference, introducing the concept of noise-limited wireless networks as opposed to interference-limited ones. The noise-limited or interference-limited regime heavily reflects on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and on proper resource allocation and interference management strategies. Yet, these regimes are ignored in current approaches to mmWave MAC layer design, with the potential disastrous consequences on the communication performance. In this paper, we investigate these regimes in terms of collision probability and throughput. We derive tractable closed-form expressions for the collision probability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave ad hoc networks, operating under slotted ALOHA. The new analysis reveals that mmWave networks may exhibit a non-negligible transitional behavior from a noise-limited regime to an interference-limited one, depending on the density of the transmitters, density and size of obstacles, transmission probability, operating beamwidth, and transmission power. Such transitional behavior necessitates a new framework of adaptive hybrid resource allocation procedure, containing both contention-based and contention-free phases with on-demand realization of the contention-free phase. Moreover, the conventional collision avoidance procedure in the contention-based phase should be revisited, due to the transitional behavior of interference, to maximize throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks. We conclude that, unless proper hybrid schemes are investigated, the severity of the transitional behavior may significantly reduce throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks.},

This reduces the received power, particularly at higher frequencies such as millimeter wave (mmWave). We consider a form of macro-diversity in a mmWave cellular network in which a mobile user attempts to connect to two base stations (BSs) simultaneously, to increase the probability of having at least one LOS link. We develop a framework for determining the LOS probability when taking into account the correlation between blockages: for example, a single blockage close to the device could block multiple BSs. We also show that the BS density must scale as the square of the blockage density to maintain a given level of LOS probability.},

The paper itemizes the fundamental fading and types of degradation. Two types of fading, large-scale and small-scale, are described. Two manifestations of small-scale fading (signal dispersion and fading rapidity) are examined, and time, the examination involves two aspects: and fading, frequency. Two degradation categories are defined for dispersion: frequency selective and fast, flat fading. Two degradation categories are defined for fading rapidity: and correlation, slow. A mathematical model using and transform, power density functions is presented. This model yields a symmetry to help view the Fourier and phenomena, duality relationships that describe the fading},
